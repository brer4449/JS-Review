## How to Use this Repo:

- Fist git clone the repo (using the green code button with download icon)
- Copy the first repo link you see and in your git bash, in the directory where you want this repo to live, do the command: `git clone <repo link here>`
- Whenever you want the updated code from this repo, just `git pull origin main` (if that doesn't work try master)
- BE MINDFUL that if you are writing your own code in the files in the cloned repo, there will be conflicts when you pull because you are essentially replacing whatever you have written with the current code on this main repo.
- To avoid the above, copy paste your code somewhere else, or work on your own code OUTSIDE of the repo.
- You can always copy the files from this repo and put them somewhere local, that way you'll have them on your machine and you can edit them without fear of conflicts.
